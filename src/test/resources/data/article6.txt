Another 136,000 people who live within 20-30km of the plant have been encouraged by the authorities to leave or to stay indoors.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the evacuation would be a "long-term" operation.
In a televised address, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he was "prepared for a long-term battle" at the plant - one he said that would be won.
