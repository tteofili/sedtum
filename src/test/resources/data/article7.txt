"The material passes through the ring and basically causes the entire ring to be slightly tilted with respect to the planet's equatorial plane, and then it shears out to form this spiral pattern," said Dr Matthew Hedman of Cornell University in New York.
Dr Mark Showalter of California's SETI Institute remembers the moment he and Dr Hedman realised the significance of the date.
Commenting on the work, Professor Alan Fitzsimmons, a comet researcher at Queen's University Belfast, said: "The papers show exactly what you can do when you have these beautifully functioning spacecraft observing the outer planets close up."
