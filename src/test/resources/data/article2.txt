A military source close to the Gbagbo camp told Reuters news agency that pro-Ouattara forces were attacking the compound, adding that the Republican Guard and militiamen were fighting back.

A plume of smoke has been seen rising from the residence, which is located on a peninsula in Abidjan's lagoon.

Mr Gbagbo has not been seen in public for weeks. It is not clear whether he is at the compound.

A spokesman, Abdon Georges Bayeto, told the BBC: "The president is not going to step down. He's been elected for five years and we are going to put up a fight."
