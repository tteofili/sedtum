Q&A: Ivory Coast crisis
Troops supporting the UN-recognised president of Ivory Coast, Alassane Ouattara, appear poised for a final push to oust his rival, Laurent Gbagbo, who refuses to give up the presidency.

French troops have taken about 500 foreigners to a military camp amid increasing insecurity in the city.

Mr Ouattara's supporters launched a fresh offensive on Monday.
